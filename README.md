   cd spellbuddy
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with your environment variables
   ```
   # Authentication
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_here

   # OpenAI API
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini

   # Database
   DATABASE_URL=file:./spellbuddy.db
   ```

4. Generate the database schema
   ```bash
   npm run db:generate
   ```

5. Run database migrations
   ```bash
   npm run db:migrate
   ```

### Running the Application

Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000

### Building for Production

Build the application for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

Start the production server:
```bash
npm start
```

## üê≥ Docker Deployment

### Using Docker Hub Image

Pull and run the latest image from Docker Hub:
```bash
docker pull yourusername/spellbuddy:latest
docker run -p 3000:3000 -e JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key yourusername/spellbuddy:latest
```

### Building Docker Image Locally

Build and run the Docker image locally:
```bash
docker build -t spellbuddy .
docker run -p 3000:3000 -e JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key spellbuddy
```

## üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment:

1. **Build**: Builds and tests the application on every push and pull request
2. **Docker**: Creates a Docker image and pushes it to Docker Hub on every push to the main branch
3. **Versioning**: Creates tagged Docker images for every Git tag with the format `v*`

To use the CI/CD pipeline, set the following secrets in your GitHub repository:
- `DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username
- `DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN`: Your Docker Hub access token

## üì± How It Works

1. Create an account or log in to access personalized exercises
2. Set your preferences (age, interests, difficulty level)
3. The student is presented with a short Swedish text to translate
4. They first speak their translation (using speech recognition)
5. Then they write their translation
6. The AI evaluates their spelling and provides feedback
7. For any misspelled words, the student practices them until they get them right
8. Progress is tracked and used to generate personalized exercises
9. Achievements are unlocked as the student progresses
10. The student can view their progress and achievements on the progress page

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes, SQLite with Drizzle ORM
- **AI**: OpenAI API for exercise generation and spelling evaluation
